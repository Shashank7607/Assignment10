    "#In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object which can then be handled by the program. Exceptions are an important mechanism for handling errors and preventing program crashes.\n",

    "#Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the program violates the syntax rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation phase, before the program is actually executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing or misplaced punctuation, misspelled keywords, and incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors occur during the compilation phase before the program is executed. Syntax errors are generally easier to fix because the Python interpreter provides a detailed error message that indicates the specific line and character where the error occurred. In contrast, exceptions can be more difficult to diagnose and fix because they can occur at any point during the execution of the program and can be caused by a wide range of factors such as invalid user input or hardware failure."
